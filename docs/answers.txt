2. I used git rev-list --count HEAD to find the commits done to the repository,
though this counts commits that goes up to the head.

3. PS C:\Users\Kathy\Downloads\CEN4020\CENAssignment2> git log -1 --format=%cd -- \Users\Kathy\Downloads\CEN4020\CENAssignment2\README.md
Sat Oct 26 00:44:29 2024 -0400
Using the command line git log -1 --format=%cd -- \Users\Kathy\Downloads\CEN4020\CENAssignment2\README.md,
the following output above displays the date README.md was last modified 

4. Branches are used in a Git repository because:
- a team can collaborate without worrying about overwriting their peers or affecting
other's changes.
- it allows the master branch to always be in a working standpoint while the branch
is utilized to create and test features before merging with the main repository

5. The git log displays snapshots of the project history. i.e cannot check status conditions
of what I am doing right now until I commit to the repository
git status displays the condition of the working directory. 

6. git log -- \Users\Kathy\Downloads\CEN4020\CENAssignment2\Vehicle.h

    -> Declared the trivial destructors for all classes
    -> Fully formatted toString methods for all classes
    -> Added test cases in the main method for testing the implementations
    -> Added validation on value for engine sizes in the  Car class   

7. git log --grep="file"

8. in the context of object-oriented programming,
i. inheritance allows us to inherit methods and attributes
of another class and reusing this between classes
ii. polymorphism allows us to have something that can be
displayed in multiple forms or having different meanings
iii. encapsulation secures and hides data by restricting users from
seeing the methods and attributes of the class

9.
In a Dictator Lieutenants workflow, the developer pushes changes
to the assigned lieutenant repository. On the other hadn, with a
integration manager workflow, the developer makes pulls and
pushes to his own repository

10. A team of 100 developers would benefit more from a DL workflow
more than a centralized workflow because there are more steps in place
for commits to cause a bug or error in the main repository. the tasks are
also delegated accross multiple people versus one manager in a centralized
workflow, allowing there to have multiple eyes on code review.
